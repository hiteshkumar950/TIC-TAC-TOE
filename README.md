Welcome to the simple yet fun **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using Python's `tkinter` module. This project is a classic 3x3 grid game where two players take turns to mark a spot in a 3x3 grid, with the goal of forming a continuous line of their marker (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features ‚ú®

- **2 Player Mode**: Two players can take turns playing the game.
- **Winner Detection**: Automatically checks for a winner after each move.
- **GUI Interface**: Simple and interactive interface using `tkinter`.
- **Easy to Play**: Just click on the empty spots to mark them and play!

## How to Play üé≤
- The game will open a window with a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 will use X and Player 2 will use O.
- Click on an empty cell to make a move.
- The game will automatically check for a winner after each move. If a player wins, a pop-up message will appear with the winner's name.
- If the game is a draw (no empty cells left and no winner), the game will display a draw message.

## Game Logic ‚öôÔ∏è
- Rows and Columns Check: The game checks if any row or column has all cells marked by the same player.
- Diagonals Check: It also checks the two diagonals for a winning line.
- Winner: The first player to get three markers in a row, column, or diagonal wins!
